# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This is a project within the Technigo Bootcamp. 
In theis projekt I learned to: 
- Create and manipulate objects
- Create arrays
- More about manipulating the DOM using Javascript

The focus on this project is to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

## The problem

The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there should also be a button to "reveal" the mystery.

I struggled with the "Reveal Button" for a long time... but now it works! :)
